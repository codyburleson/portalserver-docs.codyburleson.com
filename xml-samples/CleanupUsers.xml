<!--  
	Use this sample to identify users and groups in your portal
	database who have been removed from the user registry, but
	not from the portal database, or users who have been muted,
	for example after too many wrong password attempts. 
	In order for the file to work properly, you must set both
	attributes cleanup-users and export-users to true. Running
	this sample file results in a file that lists those	users and
	groups and marks them for deletion. 
	The result file also lists all users who have been muted, for
	example after too many wrong password attempts.
	Before you re-import the file, check the file and remove all
	users and groups that you want to keep in the portal database.
    During XML import all users and groups that remain listed in
    the file will be removed from the portal database.
    
	NOTE: After deleting these entries via the modified XML script,
	all customizations are lost for the deleted users and groups.
